0,"predator alert: ~26/27 yr old guy who walks 2 dogs throughout campus and on west street (st that the parking garage is on). He has gone by multiple names, when I knew him years ago he went by Brian Romero, but he also uses the name wolf. He has sexually assaulted two of my friends and has used drugs to disable individuals to assault them. I am posting this on the confessional because he has tried to create bonds with Smith students and uses his dogs as a means to get women and femme people to interact with him. Because none of the assaults have happened to smith college students the college cannot ban him from the property even though he is a predator. I have seen him in the smith college gym and inside some buildings. Please be cautious. ",66
